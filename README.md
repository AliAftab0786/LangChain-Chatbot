# E-commerce Chatbot ðŸ¤– [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org) [![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-1.0+-red.svg)](https://streamlit.io) [![LangChain](https://img.shields.io/badge/LangChain-Powered-orange.svg)](https://langchain.com)

Welcome to the **E-commerce Chatbot**! This intelligent assistant uses Scrapy to scrape product data (title, price, rating) from sites like Hobbycraft, powers a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot with LangChain and Anthropic's Claude, and serves it through a sleek Streamlit UI. Clone it from [https://github.com/AliAftab0786/LangChain-Chatbot.git](https://github.com/AliAftab0786/LangChain-Chatbot.git) and start asking questions like "Whatâ€™s the price of Storage Carry Case?" or "Which products are under Rs 5,000?" ðŸš€ Features include web scraping, persistent Chroma storage, and a customizable design. To set up: `git clone`, create a virtual env (`python3 -m venv .env; source .env/bin/activate`), install deps (`pip install -U langchain langchain-anthropic langchain-community chromadb sentence-transformers python-dotenv streamlit scrapy`), and add your Anthropic API key to `chatbot/.env` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key`). Run with `cd frontend; streamlit run app.py` and visit `http://localhost:8501`. Example output: "Answer: According to the information provided, the rating for the 'Wooden Storage Box 35cm x 25cm x 17cm' is 496."

Step-by-Step Instructions

cd ~/Desktop/untitled\ folder/E-com\ ChatBot
nano README.md
Copy and paste the content above, save (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano), and exit.
2. Verify the File

3. Commit to Git
Add and commit:
bash
Wrap
Copy
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add single-section README.md"
git push origin main  # Assuming your branch is 'main'
Why This Works
Single Section: Combines all info (overview, features, setup, usage, credits) into one concise paragraph.
Attractive: Uses emojis (ðŸ¤–, ðŸš€, ðŸŒŸ), badges with links, and bold text for emphasis.
Complete: Includes your repo link, LinkedIn, setup steps, and example output.
Compact: Fits GitHubâ€™s quick-read style while remaining informative.
Itâ€™ll render nicely on https://github.com/AliAftab0786/LangChain-Chatbot.git. Let me know if you want to adjust anything further! How does this look?
